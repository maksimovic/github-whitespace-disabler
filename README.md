# Github Whitespace Disabler

Firefox extension which forces Github to open diff pages with `w=1` appended, so it always displays the changes without whitespace differences.

The extension can be obtained at: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-whitespace-disabler/

Inspired by Chrome extension which can be found here: [kemo/github-whitespace-disabler](https://github.com/kemo/github-whitespace-disabler)
